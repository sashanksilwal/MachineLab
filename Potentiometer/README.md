# Rotary Potentiometer


### Introduction
A 360 potentiometer is a rotary potentiometer that can rotate 360 degrees 
in either direction to change the resistance of the circuit.

### How it works

A potentiometer consists of a resistive element, a wiper, and two 
terminals. When the potentiometer knob is rotated, the wiper moves across 
the resistive element, changing the resistance between the two terminals. 
This change in resistance can be used to control various aspects of a 
circuit, such as volume or brightness.

### Challanges Faced

I faced challenges while trying to use the potentiometer to measure the 
number of rotations. As the potentiometer can turn in both directions, I 
had to write code that could handle this. Additionally, the range at which 
I was trying to measure did not work as expected, so I had to make 
adjustments to the code
